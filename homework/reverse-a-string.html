	/* Write a function that takes a string as a parameter. Initialize a local variable to an empty string. Using this local variable, a for loop, and indexing, write code to reverse the input string. Return the reversed string. Remember to call your function at the end, and to pass a valid argument into the function call. 

	HINTS:
				for (a; b; c) {

	a) If you want to loop through an array in reverse using the incrementation method, what index of the array does the variable i need to start as? How do we write this in code?

	b) If we are looping through an array in reverse, what value does i need to be for the loop to terminate?

	c) How do we increment or decrement i if we are looping through an array in reverse?
