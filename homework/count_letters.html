/* Write a function called countChars that counts the number of times a letter appears in a string. it should have a parameter called myStr.
The parameter should take in a string argument.
The function should contain a local variable called charCount, which is an object. The format for the property-attribute pairs should be like this: "a": 2

Your function should look at each character in the input string (the argument).
If a character is not a property in charCount, add it as such, making sure to provide an attribute.
If a character is already a property in charCount, increment the attribute.
Print and return charCount at the end of the function.

Remember to call your function and pass in a valid argument.
